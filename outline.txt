------------What is Quadratic Reciprocity?

The law of quadratic reciprocity is a well known number theoretic theorem that gives conditions for the solvability of quadratic equations modulo prime numbers.

Example: Are there solutions for x^2 + 4x congurent 10 (mod 7)?

Let p and q be distinct odd primes. Then the theorem is borken into three parts:

(-1/p) = ...
(2/p) = ....
(q/p) = {(p/q) if p or q congurent 1 mod 4, -(p/q) if p and q congruent 3 mod 4}

We will focus on the proof for the 3rd part for the rest of this article.

-------------Why is this useful?

The main use for the law of quadratic reciprocity is to compute Legendre symbols.

Legendre symbols are ....... of the form (a/p) where .... and denotes whether a solution exists to the equation x^2 congruent a (mod p).

Example: (55/179) ...

As you can see, the law of quadratic reciprocity allowed us to determine whether this equation has a solution. Finding those solutions however is a separate matter (see Quadratic residues).

-------------Proof of the Theorem

There are actually many different proofs for quadratic reciprocity. We outline two of them below.

----------A Journey through Permutations

Before we get to the second proof of quadratic reciprocity, we are going to need to learn a little bit about algebraic permutations.

A permutation of a set is defined as a bijection from the set to itself. That is, it is a function from S to S that is both injective (describe....) and surjective (describe....).

For example, say we have a permutation f: {1, 2, 3, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4} ...

Show pegboard example.....

Talk about cycle decomposition....

Show the sign of a permutation....

Sign facts:
sign(ab) = sign(a)*sign(b)
sign(m-cycle) = (-1)^(m-1)

------------Jacobi Symbols

Evaluating Legendre symbols is useful, but for large numbers, it is not feasible to factor the numerator and split into multiple Legendre symbols. This is where the Generalized Law of Quadratic Reciprocity comes in.

It states: Given positive odd integers a and b,

(-1/b) = ...
(2/b) = ...
(a/b) = {(b/a) if a or b congurent 1 mod 4, -(b/a) if a and b congruent 3 mod 4}

As you may have noticed, this statement is extremely similar to the Law of Quad. Rec. discussed above.
